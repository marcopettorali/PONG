			<h2>What's PONG?</h2>
			<p> 
				PONG is a table tennis simulator, and one of the earliest videogames ever producted. It was published from Atari in 1972, and it became very popular in the following decades in the arcades of all the world.
			</p>
			<p> 
				This is a modern version of this ever-green title, full of powerups, leaderboards and so on.

				Then you will redirected to the game page. To start a new game, press any key and select your controller side with 'A' or 'D', if you want to use the WASD controller, or the left and right arrows, if you want to use the Arrows controller.

				In the game, you want to use the W and S keys (or the arrow up and arrow down keys) to move your paddle. If the ball crosses your paddle position, your opponent gains a point. Who reaches 10 points wins the match. At the end of the match, if you've won and you played against CPU, you will gain some points for climbing up the users' leaderboard. You will receive an amount of points equal to your score minus your opponent's score. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the playground you will see, every 5 seconds, a power-up that has a positive or a negative effect. To pick a bonus just step on it with your paddle. When a player makes point, all the effects gained before are deleted and the bonuses on the screen disappear. The effects are:
			</p>


			<p>
				<b>Paddle stretch:</b> your paddle gets larger for 5 seconds.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Paddle shrink:</b> your paddle gets smaller for 5 seconds.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Cannon shot:</b> the ball becomes 5 times faster until any player makes point.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The Wall:</b> the next time the ball crosses your paddle, the ball will bounce off the wall instead of giving the opponent a point.
			</p>
